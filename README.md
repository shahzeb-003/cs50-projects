# cs50-projects

These projects are my compelted projects for the Harvard CS50 course.

As each number gets higher, the difficulty increases.

The most notable project is ./9/finance where we developed a web app called C$50 Finance for:
- portfolio management
- real-time stock price checking
- simulated buying and selling of stocks using API queries
